## Project source code structure:

- core - core generic functionality
- models - global shared enums, interfaces, model classes (prefer to avoid, define models alongside service/component)
- shared - pure and simple components, directives, pipes without domain logic and with low dependencies. Can have dependencies only to other pure entities. No backend communication
- pipes - smart pipes, with business logic. Prefer to avoid. Usually should be defined alongside component/service which functionality it uses.
- directives - smart directives, with business logic. Prefer to avoid. Same as pipes, should be defined alongside component/service/
- shared-domain - smart components, directives, services with domain logic. Backend communication is possible but not recommended. Dependencies on other smart component is possible but not recommended. Usually they represents more complex feature which consist of several shared pure components
- api - api access layer with shared services for backend communication. No business logic, no data caching. Usually autogenerated
- services - smart shared services with business logic
- utils - small helper functions. Preferably without business logic.
- views - entry components for routing. They should manage query params and other router related staff and pass data to child component as input or via service
- root - application shell ui, includes header, menu, footer etc.
